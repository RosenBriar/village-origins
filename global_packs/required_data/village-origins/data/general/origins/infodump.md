## Flying Fish
Origin that can "fly" underwater, maybe ignores water and can enter flying state to gain water mobility? Maybe see if elytra physics and water physics can exist in harmony?

- Flight: Have elytra wings that increase water mobility and can glide outside of water only if aeroflight begins as hydroflight.
Some kind of increased control over flight? I'm not sure how I'll do that, or if its even worth it.

As for other abilities, research flying fish as a species. I think japanese folklore also might yield some interesting results?

Something like an aquatic Shulk; a beast that can raise earth but functions specifically underwater. Perhaps this would be a good first origin to try making group buffs? Prismarine deserves more love too. Maybe limiting it to underwater is too harsh? Coreforged could work amazing as a pairing with this.

- Drills: Some ability that mines blocks it walks into. Probably a natural tag check? And also mine based on the pickaxe in hand? The advantage would be faster mining, making it more powerful with weaker pickaxes, though it would also destroy durability. Maybe increase movement speed with efficiency level? Also slower movement speed while in drill mode.

- A Cost: Something powerful like this should probably have a material drain, but Coreforged has already taken care of fuel usage. Maybe they could share a common hinderance? Possibly also consume prismarine shards for drilling. But how common are prismarine shards? It's difficult to say, given the fact that it's a generally useless item.
After thinking it through, I'll go with a resource that just augments the power, making it stronger so long as prismarine shards are active.
